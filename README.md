Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).  Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

I found Express easier to use and understood the HTML and Javascript.  It was closer to traditional web design I've seen before.  Angular was a little more complicated to me as there were concepts, such as TypeScript, that I have never used.  I did like the SPA and how easy it was to use CRUD functions and how they generated dynamically.  NoSQL databases are much more flexible than SQL databases.  NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, do not need a predefined schema, supports different structures, is easily scalable and can use JSON.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, which is used for data exchanges between platforms.  JavaScript is a scripting language used often in web development. The JSON format is syntactically the same as creating JavaScript objects.  JavaScript sends objects and requests to MongoDB, then MongoDB stores them in JSON.  There were many times during development that Angular components took over parts of code that were not reusable and made them resuable, which made the project more efficient.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The added security made it so the request and retrieval methods could only be done after authorization.  Once the user was authorized they could use the GET and PUT endpoints to edit or add trips.

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

Understanding the MEAN stack will help my career tremendously.  I have had some experience in front-end web development and databases, but it was quite an experience to put everything together.  Knowing the MEAN Stack could help my career if I ever want to be a web developer.  There is still more to learn about fullstack development, but this was a great first experience.
